# Custom Item Tags
Add custom text tags to any item in the game, ideal for hard to see items like Zamorakian hasta.

## Instructions
1. Find Item ID on https://www.osrsbox.com/tools/item-search/.

## Credit
The plugin was basically created by splicing together 
[Custom Menu Swaps](https://github.com/geheur/More-menu-entry-swaps/tree/master/src/main/java/com/hotkeyablemenuswaps) 
config interface with [Item Identification](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/tree/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/itemidentification) 
text rendering. Huge credit to the developers of those plugins.

I created this plugin as an exercise in learning Java. Please feel free to add suggestions and fix potentially shoddy code.
