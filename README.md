# Custom Item Tags
Add custom text tags to any item in the game, ideal for hard to see items like Zamorakian hasta.
It utilizes item IDs which can be found on https://www.osrsbox.com/tools/item-search/.

### Credit
The plugin was basically created by splicing together 
[Custom Menu Swaps](https://github.com/geheur/More-menu-entry-swaps/tree/master/src/main/java/com/hotkeyablemenuswaps) 
config interface with [Item Identification](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/tree/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/itemidentification) 
text rendering. Huge credit to the developers of those plugins.

I created this plugin as an exercise in learning Java. Please feel free to add suggestions and fix potentially shoddy code.
